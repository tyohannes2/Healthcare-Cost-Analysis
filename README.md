# Medicare Cost Analysis by State (2023)

This project analyzes public Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to compare **Average Medicare Payments** across U.S. states.

It uses Python libraries **pandas** and **matplotlib**, and is fully built in **Google Colab**. This project is part of my data portfolio to demonstrate real-world skills in public health data analysis and visualization.


## Objective

## Key Features

- ✅ Filters dataset to only include the 50 U.S. states + D.C.
- ✅ Calculates average Medicare payment per state
- ✅ Creates a clear bar chart visualization of state-level averages
